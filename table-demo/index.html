       <!-- A table has several components
            A table typically consists of a set of column headers, the row data and optionally a footer area for comments or messages
        
            However, you can design your table to any style you wish by using various style techiques such as merging columns, merging rows, merging columns and rows, placing column headers on a data row, etc....
        
            Typically, you will see a table as a tabular grid

            Tables ARE NOT to be used to layout your web page content, that should be done using css styling
        -->
        <!-- the border error on the table tag is a known error
             UNTIL css is covered, this error will be acceptable-->

        <table border="1">
            <!-- all content within a table tag set is one table
                header use <thead>
                body use <tbody>
                footer use <tfoot>
            
                a row in any section has a <tr> tag set
                
                within a row you will have several cells
                header cells use <th>
                data cells use <td>
                -->
            <thead>
                <!-- area is used for column headers
                     by default text is bolded
                     use one <th> tag set for each column-->
