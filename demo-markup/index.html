        <h2>Try Photoshop</h2>
        <p>Photoshop is part of Creative Cloud and comes with Adobe CreativeSync, so your assets are always at your fingertips right when you need them. CreativeSync powers your Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe Stock, and it connects your mobile and desktop apps.</p>
        <!-- anchor tag a.k.a link 
             AVOID using the word link for anchor BECAUSE there is a
             specific link tag
            will use BOTH content and parameters
            The content show up on your web page as a clickable link (blue)
            The parameters are used by the browse to indicate the new url and possibly opening the content in a new window-->
        <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Download Trial version</a>

        <h2>Photoshop Image</h2>
        <!-- the  img (image) tag is a void tag. This means that it is not a paired open/close tag set. There is no content to an img tag. All required information is done via parameters
    
        required parameters src (points to the location of the image) and alt (the text displayed if the image cannot be located)
     
        an option parameter is title. this parameter supplies a tool tip on the image
    -->
        <img src="img/photoshop.png" alt="photoshop icon image" title="Best digital image software possible" >

        <h2>Champions League Quarter Finals</h2>
        <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the Bayern box. It is a decent delivery, but there is nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of ease from six yards!</p>

        <!-- the tag to create an unordered list is ul. Within this set of tags, we use the line item (li) tag for each line in the list.-->
        <ul>
            <li>Barcelona</li>
            <li>Manchester United</li>
            <li>Real Madrid</li>
            <li>Paris St Germain</li>
            <li>Wolfsburg</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Open Bridge from Photoshop</h2>

<!-- an ordered list is simular to an unordered list except for the list tag which is ol-->
